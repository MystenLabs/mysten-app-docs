 ## Sui Explorer main page

The main page displays information about network statistics, current gas price, epochs and checkpoints, transaction activity, popular packages, current gas price, and a partial list of validators on the network, sorted randomly.

The **Network TPS** block shows the current transactions per second (TPS) and peak TPS on the network over the previous 30 days.

The **Current Epoch** block shows the current epoch number, time remaining until the epoch ends, and the time and day when the epoch started. Click the box to view details about the epoch, such as the checkpoints, participating validators, rewards, and storage fund balance.

The **Reference Gas Price** block shows the current gas fee for transactions, and the average gas fee over the previous 7 epochs or 30 epochs based on the setting you choose. You can display the value in MIST or SUI.

The **On the Network** box shows total number of packages, transaction blocks, and objects on the network. This is a cumulative running total since network genesis.

The **Sui Nodes** map shows the geographic location of nodes on the three Sui networks, Mainnet, Testnet, and Devnet. Larger blue dots indicate a larger larger number of nodes in the region. Hover your cursor over a country to see the number of nodes in that country.

The **Transactions** table includes the following tabs:
* **Transaction Blocks** - shows the transactions on the network, with the most recent transaction first. Click on a value in the **Digest** or **Sender** columns to view details about them. Click **More Transaction Blocks** below the table to view all transactions on the network. You can choose the number of results per page using the drop-down in the bottom-right corner.
* **Epochs** - Shows a list of completed epochs and details about them, such as transaction blocks and stake rewards. Click on an epoch number to view more details about it, or click on a checkpoint number for details about it. Click **More Epochs** below the table to view all epochs.
* **Checkpoints** - Lists the checkpoints for the current epoch and details about them. Click a value in the **Digest** column to view details about it.

The **Validators** table lists some of the validators on the network in random order. Click on a validator to view more details about that validator. Click **More Validators** at the below the table to view all current validators on the network.

The **Popular Packages** section shows the most frequently accessed packages on the network. You can choose to show data for the previous 3 days (3D), 7 days (7D), or 30 days (30D). Click a value in the **Modules** column to view details about the module, and click a value in the **Packages** column to view the associated package.

## Choose a network

You can also use the Explorer to view data for Sui Devnet, Sui Testnet, a local network running in your environment, or a custom RPC endpoint URL. Use the drop-down menu at the top-right of the page to choose a different network.
