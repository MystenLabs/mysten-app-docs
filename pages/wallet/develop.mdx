## Use Sui Wallet for testing

You can use Sui Wallet with other Sui networks to test new or updated apps on Sui. In addition to **Sui Mainnet**, Sui Wallet supports connecting to **Sui Testnet**, **Sui Devnet**, a **Local** network, or a **Custom RPC URL** on a network you create.

To learn how to create a local network, see [Create a Local Sui Network](https://docs.sui.io/build/sui-local-network).

**Change the active network connection**

1. Click the menu (the three bars) at the top-right corner of the Sui Wallet interface.
1. Click **Network**.
1. Click the network to use.
   A checkmark displays next to the active network.

## Get SUI tokens for testing

When you first open the wallet, you have no coins in it. You can add test SUI coins to your wallet to use for testing. These tokens have no value and you can use them only on the Sui network you obtain them for, such as Devnet or Testnet.

**To get SUI test coins using the wallet**
After you install the wallet extension, select one of the test networks, either Devnet or Testnet. If you have no coins in the wallet, a button displays to request tokens.Click **Request Devnet SUI tokens** or **Request Testnet SUI tokens**, depending on the network you chose. After you have coins in your wallet, the button moves to the **Settings** page. To access the **Settings** page, click the three bars in the top-right corner of the wallet interface.

**Note:** you can request SUI coins only once every 60 minutes. After you click the button, SUI test tokens appear in your wallet on the **Coins** tab.

**To get SUI test coins through Discord**

1. Click **Coins**.
1. Click the small clipboard icon next to your address to copy it.
   It's near the top of the wallet and starts with 0x.
1. Go to the Discord faucet channel for the network you use:
   - [devnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) channel in Discord.

1. Use the `!faucet` command with your wallet address to request tokens:
   `!faucet 0x6c04ed5110554acf59ff1b535129548dd9a0c741`
   Replace the address in the command with your wallet address.

The channel bot displays a message confirming your request.
