## Install Sui Wallet

To use Sui Wallet, just install the Chrome browser extension. You can use the extension with any browser that supports Chrome extensions from the Chrome Web Store.

1. Using a chromium-based browser, open the [Sui Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil) page on the Chrome Web Store.
1. Click **Add to Chrome**.
1. Acknowledge the message about permissions for the extension, and then click **Add Extension**.

## Create a new wallet

If you don't yet have a Sui Wallet, create a new one. To import an existing wallet, see [Import an existing Sui Wallet](#import-an-existing-sui-wallet).

1. Open the Sui Wallet extension in your browser and then click **Get Started**.
1. Click **Create a New Wallet**.
1. Under **Create Password**, enter a password for your wallet.
   This is not a global password for Sui Wallet. It applies only to this installation in this browser.
1. Under **Confirm Password**, enter the same password to confirm it.
1. Click the checkbox to accept the Terms of Service.
1. Click **Create Wallet**.
1. Click the crossed-out eye icon to display the recovery phrase.

1. Click **Open Sui Wallet**.

Sui Wallet prompts you to enter your password when you open it after the first use.

If you lose access to your wallet, you can recover it only with the recovery phrase. If you lose the recovery phrase, you lose access to your wallet and any coins or NFTs stored in it.
