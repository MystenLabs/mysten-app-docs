## Export the private key for an address

You can export the private key for an account to import to another wallet. You should be very careful with the private key. Anyone can use the private key to import the associated account. If someone else knows your private key, they can take over the account and cause you to lose access to it. Never share a private key.

**To export the private key for an account**
1.  Click the menu (the three bars at the top-right corner of the wallet interface), then click **Accounts**.
1.  Click the address of the account to export the key from.
1.  Click **Export Private Key**.
1.  Enter the wallet password, then click **Continue**.
1.  Click **Copy** to copy the private key to your clipboard.

You can then paste the private key to import it to a different wallet.

To view the private key, make sure that no one can see your screen, and then click the crossed-out eye icon in the bottom right corner.
