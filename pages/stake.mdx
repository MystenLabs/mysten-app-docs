## Stake and earn SUI

You can stake SUI to earn rewards for helping secure the network. When you stake SUI, you delegate your SUI tokens to a validator to stake. The validator then pays you rewards for staking your SUI with them.

Note that SUI tokens have no value on test networks.

**To stake SUI and earn rewards**

1. Open your wallet and click **Coins**.
1. Click **Stake & Earn SUI**.
1. Select a validator to stake with, then click **Select Amount**.
1. Enter the amount of SUI to stake.
   Enter an amount that leaves sufficient SUI in your wallet to cover gas fees.
1. Click **Stake Now**.
1. Review the transaction confirmation, then click the check mark to close it.
1. Click the X to close the **Stake & Earn SUI** page.

The wallet displays when you start earning rewards for your stake in the next epoch.

## View current stake

To view details about your current stakes, click **Currently Staked** on the **Coins** tab of the Wallet. Details include: the amount you staked, the validator you chose, amount earned so far, and the validator commission.

## Withdraw your staked SUI

You can withdraw your staked SUI at any time. You might want to stake with a different validator with better rewards, or use your SUI for something else. When you request a withdraw, your stake ends immediately. Validators distribute rewards at the end of each epoch.

You can't withdraw a stake request that hasn't started earning rewards yet. You can request a withdraw after the next epoch starts and the stake becomes active.

1. Click the **Coins** tab, then click **Currently Staked**.
1. Click the validator to withdraw your stake from.
1. Click **Unstake SUI**.
1. Click **Unstake Now**.
1. Click the check mark to close the **Transaction** page, then click X to close the **Staking** page and return to the **Coins** tab.
