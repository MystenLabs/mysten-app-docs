#### Can I use Sui Wallet on browsers not based on Chromium?
Currently, Sui Wallet is optimized for Chromium-based browsers. There are no immediate plans to expand support to other browser types.

#### What is a recovery phrase?
A recovery phrase is a unique 12-word text string provided when you create a wallet on Sui. It's crucial for wallet recovery and transferring your wallet account to another device. Keep it safe and secure.

#### What does it mean to Import an existing wallet?
You can import a wallet account from another wallet if you have the recovery phrase for that wallet. It is not possible to import a wallet without the recovery phrase.

#### How do I get SUI into my wallet?
Receive SUI from another address, through exchanges or directly within the Sui Wallet using a credit card. Partners like Coinbase, MoonPay, and Transak facilitate these purchases within the wallet.

#### Who are MoonPay, Coinbase and Transak?
We use third party services to allow users to purchase SUI inside the Sui Wallet. Currently, MoonPay, Coinbase and Transak provide these services inside Sui Wallet. If you have an existing account with these providers, you can use it when prompted in the purchase flow. You can also create an account if you do not already have one.

#### How do I convert my SUI back to my currency?
Direct selling of SUI into fiat within the Sui Wallet is not supported. Transfer your SUI to an exchange to convert it back to your preferred currency.

#### My NFTs are in my wallet, but I can’t see the images, why?
Sui Wallet uses the Object Display standard for showing NFT images. If an NFT does not adhere to this standard, the wallet will display the asset without its image.

#### How do I send SUI to another person?
To send SUI to another wallet, you just need the wallet address. Note you can send only to wallets that support the SUI token, and use 32 or 64 byte addresses. Simply use the Send button in your wallet, enter the amount and the recipient wallet address. Ensure to double check the wallet address, you can’t reverse completed transactions. SUI cannot be recovered if you entered an incorrect address.

#### Failed Transactions and Gas Fees:
Transactions can fail due to various issues but still incur gas fees to compensate validators. In some cases, you might even receive a positive SUI transfer if a failed transaction deletes gas objects, resulting in a negative gas fee.

#### My transactions failed, why do I still pay the gas fee?
Transactions can fail for a number of reasons, such as being incorrectly specified or incorporating an insufficient gas budget (for more details on gas budgeting read Gas in Sui). Failed transactions still incur gas fees in order to compensate validators for the time spent attempting to process the transaction.

#### My transactions failed, why did I pay a negative gas fee?
In some cases, failed transactions may update or delete gas objects before failing. In such cases, the storage rebates associated with deleting gas objects may more than offset the computation charges charged by the failed transaction and deliver a negative gas fee. In other words, the user may receive a positive SUI transfer even though their transaction failed.

#### What is staking?
Staking allows you to earn rewards by placing your SUI with validators on the network who verify transactions. Sui is a Proof-of-Stake network and validators play a key role in maintaining the accurate state and security of the network. Each validator decides on the rewards they offer for stakes. You may stake with one or many validators at any time. The minimum staking amount is 1 SUI. For more information on staking, visit the Sui Tokenomics article(opens in a new tab).

#### How do I track my stake?
You can view your current stakes on the Home tab of Sui Wallet, including the average APY earned from all of the validators you staked with.

#### Can I set up alerts for my stake?
Sui Wallet does not support alerts at this time. Sui epochs last 24 hours, and stake rewards are calculated and distributed after each epoch concludes. You can withdraw your stake at any time.

#### What is the Playground?
The Playground lists apps on the Sui network that may be of interest. Apps are actively curated, but do not indicate any endorsement or relationship with Sui Wallet or Mysten Labs. Please do your own research before you connect your wallet to any site.

#### What does Active Connections mean?
Active Connections shows any apps that are currently connected to your Sui Wallet. The apps include any that you previously connected your wallet to. Connections persist even if you haven’t carried out any transactions. Sui Wallet requires you to approve any transaction that uses your address even after you connect your wallet to a site. To remove a connection, click on it and then click Disconnect.

#### Where can I see more detail about my transactions and activity?
The Activity tab on Sui Wallet shows a high-level list of all of your transactions. Click on a transaction to view details about it. You might need to scroll down to see the link on large or complex transactions.

#### My wallet keeps logging me out, how do I stop this?
Sui Wallet automatically times out to protect your account. You can increase this time out from the burger menu on the top right. You can increase the Auto-lock to a maximum of 30 minutes.

#### Network and Version Updates:
Ensure you're connected to the correct network for your activities. Network resets, like on Devnet, may temporarily affect asset visibility.

#### I think someone has access to my Sui Wallet, what do I do?
If you think someone has access to your wallet you should immediately transfer any assets in your wallet to another account address. You should also consider:
- Check your device for viruses and malware
- Confirm that your passphrase is securely stored and that no one has accessed it
- Check a Sui transaction explorer for any unrecognized activity associated with your wallet address

Can I update my [seed phrase/mnemonic] to something more memorable?
The passphrase generated by Sui Wallet cannot be changed to something more memorable. Always keep your recovery phrase secure.
