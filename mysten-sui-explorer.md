[Sui Explorer](https://explorer.sui.io/) lets you view data about transactions and activity on the Sui network. In addition to viewing activity on the network, you can use the Explorer to:
 * View up-to-date information about the activity and metrics on the Sui network.
 * Look up, verify, and track your assets and contracts.
 * Utilize fast, reliable, and transparent debugging and auditing data to help identify and resolve issues.
 * Get go-to-definition support for all smart contracts, referred to as packages in Sui.
 * View validators and geographic locations of currently active Full nodes.

 See the [Sui Explorer README](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/apps/explorer#readme) for instructions on how to run the Explorer locally.

## Choose a network

When you open Sui Explorer, it displays the transactions for the Mainnet network by default. You can also use the Explorer to view data for Sui Devnet, Sui Testnet, a local network running in your environment or a custom RPC endpoint URL. Use the drop-down menu at the top-right of the page to choose a different network.

## Finding your transaction

You can search for the transactions using an address, object ID, or transaction ID. For example, you can search for your wallet address to confirm a transaction or view additional details about a transaction you’ve approved. See [Sui Wallet](../explore/wallet-browser.md) to learn how to create a wallet.

**To search for a transaction made using the Sui Wallet**
1. Open your Sui Wallet.
1. Click the clipboard icon to copy your wallet address.
1. Open the Sui Explorer.
1. In the search field, paste your wallet address and then press **Enter**.

The Explorer displays the **Address** details page for your wallet address. You should see the same transaction in Explorer that you see in your wallet history. Click on a transaction to view the details for it.
